## Project Structure

Here's what each directory contains:

### `advanced/`
Contains advanced components for production deployment:

- **`api_fastapi/`**: FastAPI-based REST API server
  - `main.py`: Entry point for the web API
- **`dbt_project/`**: Data transformation pipeline using dbt
  - `models/features/`: Feature engineering models
- **`feast_repo/`**: Feature store for machine learning
  - `feature_views.py`: Definitions for feature views

### `src/`
Core application source code:

- **`rag/`**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation components for AI-powered advice

### `docs/`
Documentation and configuration:

- **`sql/`**: SQL scripts and database documentation
- `policies.yaml`: Policy definitions for compliance and risk management
