# Financial Decision-Making System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a financial decision-making system using advanced technologies and frameworks. The system provides sophisticated financial analysis capabilities through momentum and volatility features that help in understanding market trends and risks.

## Key Technologies
- **FastAPI** for building APIs
- **DBT** for data transformation and feature engineering
- **Feast** for feature storage and serving

## Core Financial Features

### Momentum Features
Momentum features help identify trends and price movements in financial markets. These indicators are crucial for:

- **Trend Analysis**: Understanding the direction and strength of price movements
- **Entry/Exit Timing**: Identifying optimal points for trading decisions
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating momentum-based investment strategies

**What is Momentum?**
Momentum in finance refers to the tendency of assets that have performed well (or poorly) in the recent past to continue performing well (or poorly) in the near future. It's measured as the rate of change in price over a specific time period.

**Key Momentum Indicators:**
- Rate of Change (ROC) over multiple timeframes (5, 10, 20 days)
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- Relative strength measurements
- Momentum classification (Strong Positive, Moderate Positive, Neutral, etc.)

**Significance in Financial Analysis:**
- Helps identify trending markets and potential reversals
- Essential for momentum-based trading strategies
- Used in portfolio optimization and asset allocation
- Provides signals for risk management decisions

### Volatility Features
Volatility features measure the degree of price variation and market uncertainty. These metrics are fundamental for:

- **Risk Management**: Quantifying and managing investment risk
- **Position Sizing**: Determining appropriate investment amounts
- **Options Pricing**: Essential input for derivatives valuation
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Balancing risk and return

**What is Volatility?**
Volatility measures how much the price of a financial instrument varies over time. Higher volatility indicates greater price swings and increased uncertainty, while lower volatility suggests more stable price movements.

**Key Volatility Indicators:**
- Rolling standard deviation of returns (5, 10, 20, 30 days)
- Average True Range (ATR) for gap-adjusted volatility
- Annualized volatility for standardized comparison
- Historical volatility patterns
- Volatility regime classification (Elevated, Suppressed, Normal)

**Significance in Financial Analysis:**
- Critical for risk assessment and management
- Used in portfolio diversification strategies
- Essential for options and derivatives pricing
- Helps identify market regime changes
- Key input for Value at Risk (VaR) calculations

## How These Features Work Together

Momentum and volatility features complement each other to provide a comprehensive view of market conditions:

- **High Momentum + Low Volatility**: Strong, stable trends (ideal for trend-following strategies)
- **High Momentum + High Volatility**: Strong but unstable trends (requires careful risk management)
- **Low Momentum + Low Volatility**: Sideways, stable markets (suitable for range-trading strategies)
- **Low Momentum + High Volatility**: Choppy, uncertain markets (typically avoided or hedged)

## Implementation Architecture

The system calculates these features using DBT (Data Build Tool) for reliable, scalable data transformations:

1. **Raw Data Processing**: Clean and validate price data
2. **Feature Calculation**: Apply mathematical formulas for momentum and volatility
3. **Feature Storage**: Store results for fast retrieval via Feast
4. **API Access**: Serve features through FastAPI endpoints

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies
2. Set up your database connection for DBT
3. Configure your raw price data source
4. Run the DBT models to calculate features
5. Access features through the API or feature store
